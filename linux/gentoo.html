            <p>I cannot state how much I love and hate Gentoo Linux. It is by far my most favourite distro out there. But I have gripes about it. Lets start.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Lets first talk about the pros. Gentoo is extremely customisable- and I mean extremely. It is pretty crazy on how minimal you can make a Gentoo system. Gentoo also has portage, one of the best package managers out there, if not the best. Portage can compile directly from source, it can manage packages outside of official repos, and thats the tip of the iceberg. Gentoo also has extremely good documentation, its wiki is incredible and its probably the best wiki I have ever seen for a distro.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now on with the cons. I would say the biggest problem with gentoo is its barrier to entry. While customization is important, if its difficult to do that, then its an issue. Installing the operating system is also very difficult, but also slightly misleading and unclear. When you want to use a kernel for your system, the wiki nudges you in the direction of doing a custom kernel, when that simply isn't necessary. You can use a premade kernel or a binary one- which is a-lot easier to do. Unfortunately, I will probably get told by gentoo tryhards that "Oh, installing gentoo is a piece of pie!" but it simply isnt. I don't want to spend more time installing the Operating System than using it. But once you do get it installed, its such a large rush of dopamine that you feel like its worth it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>But with the pros and the cons out of the way- its an extremely solid operating system. Its clear how its a hobbyist OS, but if you want to put in the time, effort, blood, sweat, and tears (or if you hate yourself) to install this distro, do it. I promise you won't regret it, other than the time you spent compiling your kernel.</p>
